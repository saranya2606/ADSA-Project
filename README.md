# Flight Tracker 


The Flight Tracker App is an Android application designed to help users find the shortest path between airports within a network. It allows users to input airport details, such as the number of connections between airports and the distances (weights) between them, and calculates the shortest path between a specified source and destination airport.

The flight_cpp.cpp is c++ file that has the base implementation of dijkstra's algorithm using fibonacci heap. This logic is then being implemented in kotlin in the android application
